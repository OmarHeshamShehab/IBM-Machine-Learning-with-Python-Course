# IBM Machine Learning with Python Course

This repository contains course materials and exercises for the "IBM Machine Learning with Python" course. The course covers various machine learning algorithms and techniques, providing practical examples and datasets for hands-on learning.

## Course Overview

- **Types of Machine Learning Algorithms**: This course describes various types of machine learning algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and explains when to use each type.
- **Classification Methods**: We compare and contrast linear classification methods, including multiclass prediction, support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression, highlighting their strengths and appropriate use cases.
- **Python Implementation**: Learn to write Python code that implements various classification techniques such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision trees, and regression trees.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the results from simple linear, non-linear, and multiple regression models on datasets using different evaluation metrics to understand model performance.
